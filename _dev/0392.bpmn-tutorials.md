## Flows for APEX BPMN Tutorials

We've created a series of short tutorials to take developers through the basics of creating and running a business process model in BPMN, using the <b><i>Flows for APEX</i></b> Flow Modeler and Flow Monitor.

If you work through this series of quick tutorials, you'll be able to use <b><i>Flows for APEX</i></b> to model your business processes, and then execute processes in APEX.
Each tutorial is a Flows for APEX model that explains how it runs and how it is constructed.

If you are already familiar with how BPMN works in Flows for APEX, but want to see what changed in recent versions, see the BPMN  tutorials for upgraders page. {: .notice--tip}

Each tutorial is a Flows for APEX model that explains how it runs and how it is constructed.  You can open each model in the Process Modeler, to see how it has been configured.  You can modify and save your own copy of the model if you want to experiment.  And you can execute the model using the Flow Monitor, stepping through the model, step by step.

### Installing the Tutorials

If you are running the tutorials on your own system, you might need to run the tutorial installation script first to install the tutorials.  Look in the distribution files for `\bpmn_tutorials\install_tutorials.sql`, which can be run from SQLDeveloper, SQLcl, etc.
