# BPMN Events ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-start-event-none"></span> , <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-intermediate-event-none"></span> , <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-end-event-none"></span> )

This section covers a introduction to BPMN Events.  In BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), **events** represent something that *happens* during a process. They are key elements that define when a process starts, how it reacts to triggers, and how it ends.  Although BPMN has many event types, which initially appear confusing, events are characterised on several different properties.

## BPMN Event Types

In BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), **events** represent something that *happens* during a process. They are key elements that define when a process starts, how it reacts to triggers, and how it ends.

Flows for APEX supports a range of standard BPMN event types. Here are the most commonly used ones:

### **ðŸŸ¢** **Start Events ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-start-event-none"></span> ) **

- **Purpose**: Indicate where and how a process begins.

- **Types**:
  - **None** ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-start-event-none"></span> ) â€“ A generic start point.
  - **Message Start** ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-start-event-message"></span> )  â€“ Triggered by an incoming message.
  - **Timer Start** ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-start-event-message"></span> )  â€“ Begins at a scheduled time or recurring interval.

### **ðŸŸ¡** **Intermediate Events**  ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-intermediate-event-none"></span>) 

**Purpose**: Represent events that occur during the process, affecting its flow.

- **Types**:
  - **Message Intermediate** â€“ Wait for or send a message.
  - **Timer Intermediate** â€“ Wait for a specific duration or timestamp.
  - **Error Intermediate** â€“ Handle errors thrown in a subprocess or task.
  - **Escallation Intermediate** -- Escallate handling of a subprocess or a task

There are two subtypes:

- **Catching events** ( outlined type,  e.g., <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-intermediate-event-catch-message"></span> ) â€“ Wait for something to happen.
- **Throwing events** ( solid type, e.g., <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-intermediate-event-throw-message"></span>)  ) â€“ Indicate that something has happened.

In addition, ther are two categories of Iintermediate. events, dependant on their location in the process diagram:

- **Standalone Intermediate Events** -- placed directly in the process flow, and which represent an action that occurs or waited for during the process.
- **Boundary Events** -- are attached to the boundary of an activity (typically a task, subprocess or call activity) and represent something that might interrupt or influence that activity.  They monitor for events while the activity is running. Boundary events can be:
   - **Interrupting** (solid line) - Cancels the activity when triggered, or
   - **Non-Interrupting** (dashed line) - Runs in parallel without stopping the activity.

### **ðŸ”´**  **End Events** ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-end-event-none"></span>  )

- **Purpose**: Indicate how and why the process ends.

- **Types**:
  - **None** â€“ Generic end of a process. ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-end-event-none"></span> )
  - **Message End** â€“ Sends a message when the process ends. ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-end-event-message"></span> )
  - **Error End** â€“ Ends the process due to an error (can be caught). ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-end-event-error"></span> )
  - **Terminate End** â€“ Instantly stops the entire process, regardless of running tasks. ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-end-event-terminate"></span> )
