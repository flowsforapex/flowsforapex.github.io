## Designing Message Flow Messages Structures

This page uses the message flow example in Tutorial 7b, and provides sample Message Header and Message Payload design to make a 3-way process collaboration work.

The Message Flow example in Tutorial 7b, shown below, takes a process involving three different companies, collsborating to buy, sell, and ship some goods in an order.  In order to show a full demo of the interaction between the participants here, the diagram contains the inner working of the processes - even though they are taking place at three different companies.

**Pro Tip:** If you have the Enterprise Edition with the AskFlo AI Assistant connected, you can get information on the message structures in a collaboration.  Use the 'Messaging' quick action button to create a summary of all of the messages on a diagram.   You can then ask the assistant for more information if required.
{: .notice--info}

Note that opening messages, sent to a Message Start Event, typically contain just a message name - all of the information is in the payload because the receiving party is not yet aware of the transaction / process that you are starting.  Once the process has been started, information known to both parties at that time can be used for message header keys.

### Customer Messages

1. **Purchase Order (PO)**

   * **Message Name** :`purchaseOrder`
   * **Key Name and Key Value**: null - because this message starts off a new process at its recipient.
   * **Payload** :
     **json**
   
   ```json
   {
     "customer": "CustomerCo",
     "customerPO": "PO123",
     "dateRequired": "2024-12-30T12:00:00",
     "purchaseItems": [
       {"UPC": "24586356789", "qty_reqd": 20},
       {"UPC": "24586456862", "qty_reqd": 10}
     ]
   }
   ```
2. **Sales Order (SO) Confirmation**

   * **Message Name** :`salesOrder`
   * **Key Name** :`customerPO`
   * **Key Value** :`PO123`
   * **Payload** :
     **json**

   ```json
   {
     "supplierSalesOrder": "SO4567",
     "orderItems": [
       {"UPC": "24586356789", "qty_ordered": 20, "unit_price": 12.56},
       {"UPC": "24586456862", "qty_ordered": 10, "unit_price": 86.56}
     ]
   }
   ```
3. **Delivery Order**

   * **Message Name** :`deliveryOrder`
   * **Key Name** :`customerPO`
   * **Key Value** :`PO123`
   * **Payload** :
     **json**

   ```json
   {
     "ShipFrom": "MySupplierCo",
     "SupplierRef": "SO5678",
     "orderItems": [
       {"UPC": "24586356789", "qty_ordered": 20},
       {"UPC": "24586456862", "qty_ordered": 10}
     ],
     "mode": "air",
     "waybill": "45673647741578"
   }
   ```
4. **Invoice**

   * **Message Name** :`sendInvoice`
   * **Key Name** :`customerPO`
   * **Key Value** :`PO123`
   * **Payload** :
     **json**

   ```json
   {"the bill": "..."}
   ```

### Supplier Messages

1. **Purchase Order (PO)**

   * **Message Name** :`purchaseOrder`

   * **Payload** : Same as the Customer's PO payload provided above.
   
2. **Sales Order (SO)**

   * **Message Name** :`salesOrder`
   * **Key Name** :`customerPO`
   * **Key Value** :`PO123`
   * **Payload** : Same as the SO payload above for Customer.
   
3. **Shipping Instructions**

   * **Message Name** :`shippingInstruction`
   * **Key Name and Key Value**: null - because this message starts off a new process at its recipient.

   ```json
   {
     "ShipFrom": "MySupplierCo",
     "SupplierRef": "SO5678",

     "CustomerRef": "PO123",
     "DateRequired": "2024-12-30T12:00:00",
     "orderItems": [
       {"UPC": "24586356789", "qty_ordered": 20},
       {"UPC": "24586456862", "qty_ordered": 10}
     ]
   }
   ```
   
4. **Delivery Confirmation**

   * **Message Name** :`deliveryConfirmation`
   * **Key Name** :`supplierSO`
   * **Key Value** :`SO5678`
   * **Payload** : Same as the Delivery Confirmation payload below from the Shipper.
   
5. **Invoice**

   * **Message Name** :`sendInvoice`
   * **Key Name** :`customerPO`
   * **Key Value** :`PO123`
   * **Payload** : Same as the Invoice payload above for Customer.

### Shipper Messages

1. **Shipping Instructions**

   * **Message Name** :`shippingInstruction`
   * **Payload** : Same as the Supplier's Shipping Instructions payload.
   * **Key Name and Key Value**: null - because this message starts off a new process at its recipient.
   
2. **Delivery Confirmation**

   * **Message Name** :`deliveryConfirmation`
   * **Key Name** :`supplierSO`
   * **Key Value** :`SO5678`
   * **Payload** :
     **json**

   ```json
   {
     "ShipFrom": "MySupplierCo",
     "SupplierRef": "SO5678",
     "ShipTo": "MyCustomerCo",
     "CustomerRef": "PO123",
     "deliveredItems": [
       {"UPC": "24586356789", "qty_ordered": 20},
       {"UPC": "24586456862", "qty_ordered": 10}
     ],
     "mode": "air",
     "waybill": "45673647741578",
     "dateDelivered": "2024-10-02T08:47:00",
     "signedForBy": "Bill Smith"
   }
   ```

Adjusting the communication structure in this way ensures clarity and accuracy in representing the message exchanges as defined in the BPMN diagram.
