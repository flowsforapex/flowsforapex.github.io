### Integration into an APEX application

#### Create a new APEX application

Create a new APEX application and call it Getting Started

#### Import the plug-ins

- Go to Shared Components --> Plug-ins and click on Create
- Choose the option "As a Copy of an Existing Plug-in" and click on Next
- Select the *Flows for APEX* application and click Next
- Import all the plug-ins except "Flows for APEX - Modeler" by clicking on Copy Plug-ins

#### Use the Manage Flow Instance plug-in

- On page 1, create a new region:
  - Identification:
    - Title: My Tasks
    - Type: Static Content (default)
  - Layout:
    - Position: Content Body
- Add a new button on the same page:
  - Identification
    - Button Name: CREATE_INSTANCE
    - Label: Create Instance
  - Layout:
    - Region: My Tasks
    - Button Position: Edit

![Getting Started Integration Step 1](/assets/images/getting-started-10.png "Getting Started Integration Step 1"){: .align-center}

- Add a new process on the same page:
  - Identification:
    - Name: Create and Start Instance
    - Type: Flows for APEX - Manage Flow Instance [Plug-in]
  - Settings:
    - Action: Create and Start (default)
    - Flow Instance Name: Getting Started - &APP_USER.
    - Select Flow Using: Static Text (default)
    - Flow (Diagram) selection based on: Name (default)
    - Set Business Reference: none (default)
    - Return Instance ID into: none (default)
    - Set Process Variables?: No Process Variables (default)
  - Server-side Condition:
    - When Button Pressed: CREATE_INSTANCE

![Getting Started Integration Step 2](/assets/images/getting-started-11.png "Getting Started Integration Step 2"){: .align-center}

Now, run your application and click on the Create Instance button. Nothing happens? Are you sure?
Go on the engine app and open the Flow Monitor page. As you see, we just create a new instance and if you click on the Name you will see that it is also running.

![Getting Started Integration Step 3](/assets/images/getting-started-12.png "Getting Started Integration Step 3"){: .align-center}

That's cool but you didn't see anything on your custom application so lets see if we can fix that.

#### Display the tasks

*Flows for APEX* comes with several views to help you to integrate it into your application, one of them is the flow_task_inbox_vw view.

- Update the region "My Tasks":
  - Identification:
    - Type: Classic Report
  - Source
    - Location: Local Database
    - Type: SQL Query
    - SQL Query
      ```sql
      select sbfl_id,
            sbfl_prcs_id,
            sbfl_process_name,
            sbfl_prcs_init_ts,
            sbfl_current_name,
            sbfl_status,
            sbfl_step_key
      from flow_task_inbox_vw
      where sbfl_dgrm_name = 'Getting Started'
      ```

Save and run the page and you should now see the list of tasks that need to be completed!

#### Display the workflow viewer

One major advantage of *Flows for APEX* is the ability to see the workflow state graphically and we provide a plug-in and a view to make it easier.

- Create a new plug-in page
  ![Getting Started Integration Step 5](/assets/images/getting-started-14.png "Getting Started Integration Step 5"){: .align-center}

- Choose the "Do not associate this page with a navigation menu entry" and click on Next
- Select the view flow_instance_details_vw and click on Next
  ![Getting Started Integration Step 8](/assets/images/getting-started-17.png "Getting Started Integration Step 8"){: .align-center}

    - Type: Hidden

![Getting Started Integration Step 10](/assets/images/getting-started-19.png "Getting Started Integration Step 10"){: .align-center}

- Select the region Workflow Viewer and under Source/Where Clause add: `prcs_id = :P2_PRCS_ID`

![Getting Started Integration Step 11](/assets/images/getting-started-20.png "Getting Started Integration Step 11"){: .align-center}

- Edit the page 1, on the "My Tasks" Region make the following changes:
  - Column SBFL_ID
    - Identification:
      - Type: Hidden Column
  - Column SBFL_PRCS_ID
    - Identification:
      - Type: Link
    - Heading:

Now it's time to complete that task from your custom application.

#### Use the Manage Flow Instance Step plug-in

- Create a new blank modal page called "Task" without entry in the menu. Page ID should be 3.
- On the new page, create a new region "Task" in the Content Body and add three items:
