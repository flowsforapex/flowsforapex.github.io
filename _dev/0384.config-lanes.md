# Configuring Lanes

BPMN Lanes allow you to model who is responsible for activities.

## Adding Lanes to your Diagram

To add **lanes** to your diagram, first you must add a **participant** object ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-participant"></span> ) onto your model from the object palette.

Once you have a *participant*, you can divide it into multiple **lanes**, using the lane division tools.   Select the *participant*, and you will see the lane creation tools on the object tool palette:

- <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-lane-insert-above"></span> create lane above
- <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-lane-insert-below"></span> create lane below 
- <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-lane-divide-three"></span> divide into 3 lanes  
- <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-lane-divide-two"></span> divide into 2 lanes  

To create a **child lane set**, i.e., a lane set within one of the existing lanes, select the *lane* that you want to further divide, and select:

- <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-lane-divide-two"></span> divide into 2 lanes  

To add more than 2 lanes to the *child lane set*, start by creating two and then add lanes above or below in the child lane set.

## Configure Lanes

To configure a **lane**, select the lane object from your process diagram in the BPMN Modeler.

You can specify whether a lane  maps to an APEX role, and if so, the name of that role.  ([see discussion here](/{{page.collection}}/using-lanes-for-assignment/)) The Role information is then used as  the default role for all tasks in the lane, unless they have more specific task assignment information defined.

To configure, select the lane object in your process diagram, and set **is role** and specify its corresponding APEX role.
