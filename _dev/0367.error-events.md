# BPMN Error Events 

This section introduces BPM Error Events and describes how to configure them.

## Error (Throw) EndEvents and Error (Catch) Boundary Events.

![Error Boundary Events](/assets/images/ErrorBoundaryInSubProcess.png "Error Boundary Events")

This process has a SubProcess A.  In the sub-process, there is an exclusive gateway 'is error?' which tests for a process error.  If there is a *process error*, the process ends at an Error End Event.

Note that an error in this context is a *process error*, not a technical error in the application -- which would be handled by the application technology.

**Behavior with an Error Catch Boundary Event**.  Behaviour on an error event is:

- An Error End always interrupts processing in the sub-process ( hence error throw events are always end events).  On reaching an error end event, all processing in the sub-process, and any of its running child sub-processes, are terminated.

- Terminated objects are not marked as having been completed on the progress chart.

- If the immediate parent process contains an Error Boundary Event, processing continues on that path in the immediate parent.

In the  example above, the step execution sequence would be: 
1. <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-task-none"></span> Task `Error A`
2. <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-end-event-error"></span> Error End Event  `A Error End` 
3. <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-intermediate-event-catch-error"></span> Boundary Catch Event   `Error Boundary Event` 
4. <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-task"></span> Task `Error Handler in Parent`
5. <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-end-event-none"></span> End Event `Error End`.

**Behaviour Withoutan  Error Catch Event.**  If the immediate parent process doesn't contain an Error Boundary Event, processing continues on the normal path in the immediate parent.

In the example above, if there is an error End but NOT an Error Boundary Event is not defined in the process, the step execution sequence  would be: 
1. <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-task-none"></span> Task `Error A`
2. <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-end-event-error"></span> Error End Event  `A Error End` 
3. <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-task"></span> Task `B`
4. <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-end-event-none"></span> End Event `Normal End`.
