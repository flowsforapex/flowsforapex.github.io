# Upgrading APEX to a New Version

The Flows for APEX Application is compiled against the packages contained in the version of APEX that is installed on your environment.   If you upgrade your APEX installation, for example from APEX 23.1 to APEX 23.2, you need to recompile your Flows for APEX environment by running a script that was included in your 
application distribution.

If you upgrade APEX to a new version, run the `after_apex_upgrade.sql` script as the Flows for APEX user after upgrade. 

You will be prompted / reminded to do this on opening the Flows for APEX application if it detects that APEX has been upgraded.
