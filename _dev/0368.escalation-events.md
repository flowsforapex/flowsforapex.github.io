# BPMN Escalation Events

Escalation events are used in a subprocess to signal an event or condition outside of the normal, but which is not a process error.  Escalations can be thrown by both intermediateThrowEvents and endEvents.  Both of these can throw interrupting and non-interrupting escalation events.

## Catching Escalation Events

### Escalation Boundary Event

- Interrupting Escalation Boundary Event ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-intermediate-event-catch-escalation"></span> )
- Non-Interrupting Escalation Boundary Event ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-intermediate-event-catch-non-interrupting-escalation"></span> )

An **intermediate catching escalation boundary event** catches **escalation events** that are thrown inside the activity on which they are placed.  In Flows for APEX, these can only be placed on a **sub-process** or a **call activity**.

A **non-interrupting event** causes the main activity (the sub process) to continue processing.  If the escalation event occurs, the tasks in the. escalation path will be processed in addition to the triggering path.

An **interrupting event** causes the main activity to stop, and processing would continue on the boundary event path only.

**Variable Expressions**.  A boundary event can contain a *variable expression*, which will be set when the event occurs.

## Escalation Throwing Events

### Escalation Throw Intermediate Event ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-intermediate-event-throw-escalation"></span> )

**Behaviour.**  When the process execution arrives at an **intermediate escalation throw event**, an escalation event is thrown.  If the immediate parent sub process or call activity contains an **intermediate catching escalation boundary event**, the boundary event will fire and be processed.  The throwing process continues on to its next step.

**Variable expressions**.  Any **on event** variable expressions defined on the throwing event will be processed before the escalation is processed.  This can be used to pass information about the escalation to the catching event.

### Escalation Throw End Event  ( <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-end-event-escalation"></span> ) 

**Behaviour.**  When the process execution arrives at an **intermediate escalation end event**, an escalation event is thrown.  If the immediate parent sub process or call activity contains an **intermediate catching escalation boundary event**, the boundary event will fire and be processed.  The sub process or call activity will process the event as an end event.

**Variable expressions**.  Any **on event** variable expressions defined on the throwing event will be processed before the escalation is processed.  This can be used to pass information about the escalation to the catching event.
