### Configuring Instance Archiving

Instance archiving creates a summary document in JSON format containing all logged information about a completed process instance.  This is created daily after the process instance is completed.   The document will contain everything that was captured by the logging about that instance (so the archive contents are dependant upon your settings for `logging_level`.)  The archive documents can be stored in a database table or in OCI Object Storage (using an API key or by PreAuthorization).  If you use OCI Object Storage, you can set document retrieval, retention and purging policies in the OCI Object Storage bucket to manage archive life, retrieval times, and storage cost.   For example, you might want to keep all archive documents for 5 years, but have the documents moved to a lower-cost storage tier after 2 years.

#### Default APEX Session Configuration for Asynchronous Calls

Many features of Flows for APEX require the Flows for APEX engine to be running in an APEX session.  For most operations the engine is run from inside the user's APEX application -- so inside an existing  APEX session.  HOwever, some situations, such as where the process is run from in incoming REST call or from the DBMS Scheduler (after a timer fires), there is no existing APEX Session and Flows for APEX needs to create one.

Default parameters are used if session configuration has not been provided in either process variables (on a timer), or in the Process Diagram.  The values provided in the system configuraton will be used if no other sets of session config data is found.  Administrators of high security systems may want to leave these default configuration parameters unset, so that specific values have to be provided at call or diagram level.  Any calls made without call level or diagram level parameters will then raise an error -- which might be what you want rather than relying on system-level dafault parameters.

For personal test systems and demo systems, especially on shared use systems like`apex.oracle.com`, you should keep the frequency to every 5 to 10 minutes to prevent excessive unnecessary database workload. | 5 Minutes |

### Statistics Configuration

The Statistics processes create summary information about instance and step execution, including frequency, execution times, and waiting times for user tasks and process instances.  Summary statistics are collected each day by an APEX Automation task, which creates a daily summary and a Month-To_date summary every day it runs.   In addition, daily information is used to create a Monthly Summary and a Quarterly Summary after the end o a month or quarter.
These configuration parameters control how long these statistics summaries are retained for.   As the summaries, particularly the monthly and quarterly summaries, do not require large storage volumes, we would recommend retaining monthly summaries for at least a year, and quarterly summaries for several years so that you can see information about process performance and utilization changes over longer periods.

This is a new feature in Flows for APEX v23.1, which we expect to develop further as customers get experience of generating and using these statistics.  Unless storage is a problem, we would recommend that production users collect and retain statistics for at least the default periods as we further develop and enhance the statistics features over future releases...

### Licence Configuration

This read-only panel shows the Flows for APEX edition information.   If you have purchased the Enterprise Edition, it additionally shows licencing information.

### AI Prompt Configuration

This panel is only shown on the Flows for APEX application with the Enterprise Edition when using APEX 24.1 or later, and configures quick prompts used by the Ask Flo AI Chatbot to explain, error check, translate, and suggest improvements to process diagrams in Flow modeler.

This panel allows you to modify the prompts being used in the user's language, and also allows you to specify which prompts appear as quick actions.   Typically a quick action has a sort title, which is displayed as a button in the chatbot, along with a longer prompt containing the actual prompt that will be submitted to the AI engine.

You can select which quick actions you want to have displayed for the user by setting the 'Display as Quick Action' item.

Prompts other than the system prompt are given in all of the tranlated languages used by Flows for APEX.  The system prompt is always sent to the AI engine in English.

Currently, prompts are only provided for Open AI GPT-4o model.  Additional prompts may be provided for other AI services and other AI models in the future.   If you are an Enterprise Edition customer and want AI support from additional models, please contact info@flowquest.net to discuss.
