### Add a Workflow Viewer to Your App

One major advantage of *Flows for APEX* is the ability to see the workflow state graphically and we provide a plug-in and a view to make it easier.

- Create a new plug-in page.  In the Application Builder, click **Create Page** and select **Plug-in Page**.
  ![Create Plugin Page](/assets/images/create-flow-viewer.png)
  
- Select **Flows for APEX - Viewer** and click on **Next**.
  ![Getting Started Integration Step 6](/assets/images/getting-started-15.png "Getting Started Integration Step 6"){: .align-center}
  
- Set the Page Name to **Workflow Viewer**, make sure the selected Page Mode is **Drawer**.
  Set the Data Source to be the **FLOW_VIEWER_VW** and click on **Next**.

- Change the attributes **Add Highlighting** to **Yes** and select the **Highlighting Data**.  Enable **Use BPMN Colors** to show any coloring that has been added to the diagram.  Select the **Call Activity Data** (see screenshot) and click on **Create Page**.

- Add an APEX **page item** on the Viewer region:
  - Identification:
    - Name: P3_PRCS_ID
    - Type: Hidden

- Select the region Workflow Viewer and under Source/Where Clause add: `prcs_id = :P3_PRCS_ID`

## Add the Link to the Calling Page

- Edit the page you want to link the Viewer into.  In our example, the page we're adding the Viewer into is Page 1, which already has a column containing Process ID.  
  
  
  
  - On the Column containing Process ID
    - Identification:
      - Type: Link
    - Heading:
      - Heading: "-"
    - Link:
      - Target:
        ![Configure link to Viewer](/assets/images/getting-started-config-link-to-viewer.png)
      - Link Text: `<span class="fa fa-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>`
  - Column SBFL_PROCESS_NAME
    - Heading:
      - Heading: Instance Name
  - Column SBFL_PRCS_INIT_TS
    - Heading:
      - Heading: Init Date
  - Column SBFL_CURRENT_NAME
    - Heading:
      - Heading: Current Task
  - Column SBFL_STATUS
    - Heading:
      - Heading: Status

Save and Run the page, you should now be able to click on the link and see your instance state in the Viewer!
