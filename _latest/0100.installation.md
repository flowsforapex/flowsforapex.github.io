# Installation Guide

This section covers how to install, migrate, and deinstall a Flows for APEX instance.

## Minimal System Requirements

*Flows for APEX* v25.1 minimal requirements are:

- **Oracle database**: 19c or higher
  - For RDBMS 19.3 to 19.10, you must either upgrade to a more current patch release 19.11 or later, or download and apply patch.31843028 from Oracle Support. This fix is included in 19.11.0.0.210420DBRU onwards.
- **Oracle APEX**: 24.1 or higher

**Environment**:  Flows for APEX will run on any APEX environment, including **OCI** and **on-premise** systems (including Always Free OCI tenancies and Oracle Database 23c Free Developer Release on a laptop). 

**oracleapex.com**.  You can create a test environment on **oracleapex.com** (and its Oracle-internal equivalent, apex.oraclecorp.com) but with some restrictions due to the capacity constraints on that system:

- Installation must be with the *application import* method ( there is no SQL*Net access).
- From v25.1 application import is now English language only due to import size restrictions.
- Timer polling frequency cannot be set lower than 1 minute.
