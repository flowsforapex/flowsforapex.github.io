# BPMN Activities

In BPMN, **activities** represent the core units of *work* in a process. They are the actions that must be performed to move the process forward — whether by a user, a system, or another process.

Activities are what you're *trying to get done* in a business process, and they come in different forms to suit different types of work.

### <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-task-none"></span> Tasks

A **Task** is the simplest kind of activity — a single unit of work. It might represent a user filling out a form, a system sending an email, or a service making an API call.

### <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-subprocess-collapsed"></span> Subprocesses

A **Subprocess** is a collection of steps grouped into a reusable process block. It can be used to organize complex workflows or isolate logic that's used in multiple places.

### <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-call-activity"></span> Call Activities

A **Call Activity** is a special kind of activity that *calls* another reusable process — either from within the same model or from another one. This is useful for creating modular, maintainable process architectures.

## Activity Markings

### Multi-Instance Activities <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-parallel-mi-marker"></span> <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-sequential-mi-marker"></span> <span class="bpmn-icon bpmn-icon-loop-marker"></span>

Sometimes a task or subprocess needs to be repeated — for example, sending an approval request to *multiple users* or processing a list of items, where the task or subprocess should be repeated once for each item in the list. BPMN handles this using **multi-instance activities**, which let you loop over a collection or repeat an activity multiple times, sequentially or in parallel.
