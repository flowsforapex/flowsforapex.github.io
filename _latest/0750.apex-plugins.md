# Flows for APEX Plugins and related Components

Flows for APEX comes with several plug-ins to make it easier to integrate the product into your Oracle APEX applications.
For more informations, see the help text directly in the APEX builder.

When building your Flows for APEX-based APEX application, you should subscribe to the **Flows for APEX Components** component group, which will make all of the Flows for APEX Components available in your application project.

## Installation into Your Application

These 7 plugins are shipped as part of the Flows for APEX application.  Except for the BPMN Modeler, which is only designed to be used as part of the Flows for APEX application, the other plugins can be copied (or published) into your application for use in your application. These are:

- Flows for APEX - Manage Flow Instance
- Flows for APEX - Manage Flow Instance Step
- Flows for APEX - Manage Flow Instance Variable
- Flows for APEX - Return APEX Approval Result
- Flows for APEX - Return APEX Human Task Outcome and State
- Flows for APEX - Viewer 
- Flows for APEX - Viewer (deprecated)  

The Component Group also creates:

- Application Items PROCESS_ID, SUBFLOW_ID and STEP_KEY.

In addition, there is one further plugin, the *Flows for APEX - Modeler* which is contained in the Flows for APEX application but not for use outside the Flows for APEX Application.

### Subscribing to Flows for APEX Plugins as an APEX Component Group.

All of the Flows for APEX plugins and application items required in your application to integrate with Flows for APEX are now (Flows for APEX v25.1+)  contained in an **APEX component group** named **Flows for APEX Components**.

To subscribe to the Component Group in Another App:

1. Navigate to **App Builder → Your Target Application → Shared Components → Component Groups**.
2. In the **Component Groups** report, click on **“Copy from another app”** from the **Tasks** menu.
3. In the **Copy Component Group Wizard**:

   - Choose the **Application** where the master component group resides.
   - Select the specific **Component Group** you want to copy.
   - **Toggle** the **Subscribe** flag to **On** to both copy and subscribe to the master group.
4. Click **Next**, review the list of components and actions (like Add, Refresh, Replace, Reuse), then click **Copy Component Group** to complete the subscription setup.  

## Using the Plugins

### Flows for APEX - Manage Flow Instance

This process plug-in is used to interact with a process instance and performs actions like create, start, terminate, reset and delete.

This configuration example, from our Sample App Expense Claim, shows the configuration to create and start a process instance without writing code. You can see that you can also set some process variables declaratively.

### Flows for APEX - Manage Flow Instance Step

This process plug-in is used to interact with a process instance step, available actions are complete, reserve and release.

This configuration example, from our Sample App Expense Claim, shows the configuration to complete a process instance step. As you can see that you are even able to define the routing for a specific gateway.

### Flows for APEX - Manage Flow Instance Variable

This process plug-in allows you to set and get with process variables for a specific instance from APEX item(s), JSON or SQL Query.

In this example, you can see how easy it is to define process variable from APEX page or application items
![Set Process Variables](/assets/images/plugin-variable-1.png "Set Process Variables")

### Flows for APEX - Return APEX Human Task Outcome and State

If you use APEX Human Tasks (APEX Approval Tasks or Action Tasks) for BPMN User Tasks, you should use this plugin to return the APEX task state and outcome to Flows for APEX without having to write PL/SQL code in your Task Actions.

For usage information, see the [APEX Human Tasks BPMN documentation](/{{page.collection}}/apex-human-task/).

Configure your APEX Task Action by specifying the APEX Task Parameters containing the Flows for APEX Process ID, Subflow ID, and Step Key.

### Flows for APEX - Modeler

This plugin is used in the Flows for APEX app but is a private plugin and is NOT designed for use in user applications and should not be copied into your application.

### Flows for APEX - Return APEX Approval Result (deprecated)

**Note**: In earlier releases (prior to Flows for APEX 24.1) this was not shipped in the Flows for Engine application and had to be downloaded manually.  See older documentation if you are using an older version.
{: .notice--info}

**Deprecation**:  This plugin has been replaced by the **Flows for APEX - Return APEX Human Task Outcome and State** plugin in Flows for APEX v25.1.  The original plugin is still supported, but you should upgrade your application to use the new plugin before our 2028 release.
{:  .notice--warning}

If you use APEX Approval Tasks, you can use this plugin as part of an APEX Approval Task Action to return the result of an approval task to Flows for APEX without having to write PL/SQL API calls into your application.  This would usually be used for a task in the 'Completed' status with results of 'Approved' and 'Rejected'.  

![Return Approval Result Plugin](/assets/images/approvalResultPlugin.png "Return APEX Approval Result plugin")

Configure the plugin in the Edit Action page by specifying the APEX Approval Task parameter containing the Flows for APEX Process ID (default value - 'PROCESS_ID').

### Flows for APEX - Viewer (deprecated) ( Flows for APEX prior to 24.1)

**Deprecated**: The original Flow Viewer Plugin shipped with Flows for APEX versions from v1 to v24.1.  It is **deprecated** in Flows for APEX v25.1, but still shipped - now labeled as **Flows for APEX - Viewer (Deprecated)**.  It is still supported but you should use the **Flows for APEX - Viewer** instead.  Applications using the older viewer should be converted to using the new viewer before our 2028 release.  
{:  .notice--warning}

This region plug-in can be use to display a BPMN diagram in your application, allows your users to see what are the completed tasks and what are the current ones.
![Viewer](/assets/images/plugin-viewer-1.png "Viewer Plug-in")

We provide a built-in view flow_instance_details_vw that you can use as a source, this view contains the informations needed to fill the plug-in attributes:

- The XML of the diagram in the column DGRM_CONTENT
- The list of the currents activities (colon separated) in the column ALL_CURRENT
- The list of the completed activities (colon separated) in the column ALL_COMPLETED
- The list of the activities in error (colon separated) in the column ALL_ERRORS
