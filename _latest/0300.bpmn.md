### What is BPMN?
BPMN stands for Business Process Model and Notation.  It is an OMG and ISO standard to design and document business processes in a graphical notation. You can find more details about the specification at [bpmn.org](https://www.bpmn.org/){:target="_blank"}.

### The basics of BPMN
BPMN uses a graphical notation to let the user designs and explains its business processes, the main four components are:

| Graphical Notation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![Activity](/assets/images/basics_activity.png "Activity"){: .align-center} | **Activities** are displayed as round rounded-corner rectangle and represent what work has to be done. [more information about Activities and Tasks]({{page.collection}}/bpmn-activities/) |
| ![Gateway](/assets/images/basics_gateway.png "Gateway"){: .align-center} | **Gateways** are represented as diamond shape and used to split and merge the flow. You can find more details about the different types of gateways in our current implementation [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.collection }}/gateways/). |
| ![Event](/assets/images/basics_event.png "Event"){: .align-center} | **Events** are displayed as circles and used to trigger actions like starting a flow instance. Read the following sections get started with events:<br /> - [Start and Stop Events]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.collection }}/start-and-stop-events/)<br /> - [Timer Events]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.collection }}/timer-events/)<br /> - [Message Events]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.collection }}/message-events/)<br /> - [Boundary Events]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.collection }}/boundary-events/)<br /> - [Link Events]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.collection }}/link-events/) |
| ![Sequence Flow](/assets/images/basics_sequence_flow.png "Sequence Flow"){: .align-center} | BPMN objects within your process are connected to each other with a **sequence flow** which are designed by a solid arrow. Messages can be sent to other processes with a message flow, shown as a dashed line. |

### Advanced objects

After becoming familiar with the previous elements, you may want to take a look at the advanced objects

| Graphical Notation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![Sub-process](/assets/images/advanced_subprocess.png "Sub-process"){: .align-center} | Sub Processes are a specific type of activity that are used to make diagrams cleaner by encapsulating business process inside a business process. Take a look at the [Sub Processes]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.collection }}/subprocesses/). page to know how to use it. |
| ![Call-Activities](/assets/images/advanced_callActivity.png "Call Activity"){: .align-center} | Call Activities are a specific type of activity that are used to call another business process that is contained inside a separate process diagram. Take a look at the [Call Activities]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.collection }}/callActivities/). page to know how to use it. |
| ![Pools and Lanes](/assets/images/advanced_pools_and_lanes.png "Pools and Lanes"){: .align-center} | Pools and Lanes show who should perform a task and are represented as a rectangle, one pool can contains one to many lanes. See the specific [Pool and Lanes]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.collection }}/pool-and-lanes/) page. |
| ![Message-Flow](/assets/images/messageflow-overview.png "MessageFlow"){: .align-center} | Message Flow allows you to have two or more processes interact by passing messages between processes [Messageflow]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.collection }}/messageflow/) page. |
